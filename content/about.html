<h2>About</h2>

<p class="text-lg">
  I'm a Python and Javascript developer. I have been working with a
  great team on some <a href="http://www.stoq.com.br/">Stoq</a> side projects,
  along with other independent projects. Most of my current work is being done
  on the Web, either for coding REST APIs or building frontend-heavy
  applications with
  <a href="http://emberjs.com/">EmberJS</a>,
  <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a>,
  <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">ReactJS</a>,
  <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
  or Javascript Vanilla

  I've decided to build this blog to share my thoughts with the World, either
  by posting tutorials, philosophy or random stuff.

  I currently live on São Carlos on the state of São Paulo (Brazil), where I've
  been doing my BSc in Computer Science degree.
