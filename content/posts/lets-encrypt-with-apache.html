      <code>https</code> should be a must have for every page on the web, it
      ensures private communication between the client and the server. This
      means you'll most likely not have problems with session hijacking and
      sniffing. <a href="https://hackedbellini.org/">@hackedbellini</a> told me
      SSL certificates can be very easily obtained with Let's Encrypt's client,
      so let's check it out.
    </p>
    <h2>Let's Encrypt</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a> is a initiative from
      a lot of companies, they want to allow anyone with a domain able to
      get a certificate, making the web more secure. This way, you should be
      able to generate certificates for all of your domains, without having to
      spend a penny.
    </p>
    <h2>Installing</h2>
    <p>
      You can either install their client via <code>apt-get</code>. On debian,
      they provide packages for
      <a href="https://packages.debian.org/jessie-backports/letsencrypt">jessie-backports</a>,
      <a href="https://packages.debian.org/stretch/letsencrypt">testing</a> and
      <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/letsencrypt">unstable</a>,
    </p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>
      You can clone their <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt">repo on github</a>
      and live on the edge. On this alternative you will have to execute Let's
      Encrypt client using the <code>./letsencrypt-auto</code> executable.
    </p>
    <h2>Apache</h2>
    <p>
      Getting your first certificate using apache is very simple. Just run the
      Let's Encrypt client like this
    </p>
    <pre><code>
$ letsencrypt certonly --apache
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      You should be prompted with a simple wizard to get you through the
      certificate registration & authentication process.
    </p>

    <p>
      After this the wizard, you should check the if everything went OK. Let's
      Encrypt should have modified your Apache settings to enable SSL on your
      selected domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's encrypts' certificates last only 90 days, so after doing this, you
      should setup a certificate renewal task, to be executed every period of
      time and renew your certificate.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
$ letsencrypt renew --apache
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      To do such thing from time to time, you should just setup a cronjob with:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
$ crontab -e
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Then setup the script to be executed every once in a while:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
# Everyday at 23:30 the script is executed, but it will only renew the certificate
# once it gets close to its expiry
30 23 * * * /usr/local/bin/letsencrypt renew --apache >> /var/log/le-renew.log
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      This way you can get your SSL certificates for free, so no excuses to let
      your personal portifolio or website insecure.
